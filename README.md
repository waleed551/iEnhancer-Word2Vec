Two-Layer Computational Model Leveraging Word-to-Vector and
Convolutional Neural Network
# Abstract
Enhancers are intricate cis-acting DNA regulatory regions crucial for coordinating transcriptional activity within cells.  Given their pivotal role in modulating gene expression and coordinating intricate cellular processes, understanding enhancer activity and their interactions with transcription factors and other molecular entities can provide crucial insights into the regulation of genes, contributing to advancements in biomedicine, drug development, and personalized medicine approaches. However, conventional enhancer identification methods, such as ChIP-seq or reporter gene assays, are labor-intensive and resource-heavy, necessitating the need for alternative cost and time-effective approaches with high accuracy. In this paper, we propose iEnhancer-word2vec, a two-layer computational model, to overcome the challenges associated with enhancer prediction. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically word-to-vector (word2vec), iEnhancer-word2vec transforms raw DNA sequences into continuous vector representations, capturing subtle regulatory patterns and dependencies in an interpretable format. This semantic representation facilitates the analysis of enhancer sequences, enabling the model to discern crucial features that differentiate enhancers from non-functional genomic elements. The proposed model is evaluated on a publicly available dataset and validated against state-of-the-art enhancer identification models. iEnhancer-word2vec achieves an impressive accuracy of 88.55\% for the first layer and 81.81\% for the second layer on training datasets. Similarly, on independent datasets, the model demonstrates strong performance with 78.25\% accuracy for the first layer and 78.00\% accuracy for the second layer. The results highlight iEnhancer-word2vec's superiority over existing models in identifying enhancers and their types, as it outperforms in all performance metrics. The proposed iEnhancer-word2vec computational approach streamlines the enhancer identification process, reducing the need for laborious experimental assays and offering a time-efficient and cost-effective solution with high precision. The implications of iEnhancer-word2vec's success extend to enhancing the understanding of gene regulation and fostering progress in precision medicine through personalized treatments based on individual enhancer profiles.
